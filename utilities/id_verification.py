"""
FINTRAC Identity Verification Pathway.

Determines which identity verification method applies to a client
based on FINTRAC guidelines. Pure deterministic logic, no API calls.

Methods:
- Credit file method (preferred for individuals)
- Government-issued photo ID method
- Dual-process method (two independent sources)
- Business verification (articles of incorporation + certificate of status)
